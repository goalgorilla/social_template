This is a composer based installer for the [Open Social distribution](http://www.drupal.org/project/social).

# Prerequisites

1. [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/download/)

It's just composer, isn't it awesome? :)

## Installation of Open Social

```
composer create-project goalgorilla/social_template:dev-master DIRECTORY --no-interaction
```

Composer will create a new directory called DIRECTORY. Inside you will find the html directory with the entire code base of [Open Social distribution](http://www.drupal.org/project/social). You should be able to install it like any other Drupal site.
